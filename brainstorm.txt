brainstorm file for the project

todo:
- learn how to vectorize non-numeric input
- create list of unique cards?
- create vectorized inputs from lists
- learn how to create and use LSTM networks from Tensorflow
- build and train model on formated lists
- predict lists

decklist format: 
    - one card per line
    - all lower cap
    - spaces as "_"
    - randomized
    X no sb 


input vectorization: 
    probably with word2vec CBOW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqRCEmrv1gQ 
        - faster and better for small corpuses (source to find)

    probable method:
    - load list of all lists into memory, each individual card being a list item
    model = Word2Vec(modern_meta, min_count=1, size=16)

    model 0, vsize 16, doesnt capture card proximity well... almost no related cards in the "close" ones
    model 1, vsize 32, captures it a bit better, a few related cards in similar
    model 2, vsize 128 20 epochs, maybe overtrained
    

SPECIFICATIONS:
will not deal with sideboarding
